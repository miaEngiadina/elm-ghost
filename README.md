# elm-ghost

This is basically a port of the ghost-blog API to elm. See the documentation at
https://docs.ghost.org/api/content for all details.

## Usage

There are only two modules that need to be included `Ghost` and `Ghost.Params`.
The first contains all functions and types that are required to talk to your
ghost blog, while the later is used to defined any kind of configuration.

``` elm
import Ghost
import Ghost.Params
```

``` elm

```
